HIGH Priority:
 - Add Password reset option
 - Make documentation

Medium Priority:
 - Add descriptions and infoboxes to tasks and maybe to fix things
 - Add inputs: checkbox, radio
 - Merge scatters, avoid indexing if possible
 - Make file input process "" to be able to add files with spaces in them
 - Make a unique file input that does this processing every time not just on input
 - Add custom input to select and radio
 - Add raw text generator input

Low Priority:
 - Test compatibility with other browsers
 - Add the removeoption task output to make outputs removable manually
 - Make multilayer scattering
 - Record last modified time
 - Add more input protection: no empty string inputs, paired data should be checked for file amount to be even
 - Add hidden option for tasks to skip command on generation
 - Add guest mode
 - Ideas for new input types
 - Add complex outputs (pairs, structs, arrays), these can be used with the "access" tag but may make them unique output types
