HIGH Priority:
 - More task definitions
 - Stylize the webpage
 - Add Password reset option
 - Make wdl generator actually export file
 - Test wdls (kindof obvious)
 - Add inputs: raw text, Shown text
 - Make documentation

Medium Priority:
 - Add way to keep task inputs from being removed (and update fastqc accordingly)
 - Add descriptions and infoboxes to tasks and maybe to fix things
 - Add inputs: checkbox, radio
 - Merge scatters, avoid indexing if possible
 - Add complex outputs (that include stuff like structs pairs, possibly make pair automatic)
 - Make file input process "" to be able to add files with spaces in them
 - Make a unique file input that does this processing every time not just on input
 - Add custom input to select and radio

Low Priority:
 - Test compatibility with other browsers
 - Add the removeoption task output to make outputs removable manually
 - Make multilayer scattering
 - Record last modified time
 - Add more input protection: no empty string inputs, paired data should be checked for file amount to be even
